# Mock-Car-Rental-Agency

This project is a mockup of a car rental agency. The cars available are able to be rented and returned based on updated availability. 
Customers have the opportunity to sort the vehicles in many ways including the make and model of the car. 
The program reads from the file of cars when a customer makes an inquiry, then writes back to the file the updated list after a rental has been verified.
This project is done in object-oriented Java.
